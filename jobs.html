          talent—allowing those partners to become their personal best.</dd><br>
      <dt><strong>Store Managers</dt></strong><br>
        <dd>Store Managers run their own million-dollar business—from managing
          their store’s operations to responsibility for
          financial results. This is not a back room management position. It’s
          being on the front line, connecting with customers and
          partners. It’s the opportunity to develop your own team, hiring and
          welcoming new partners and future leaders for your
          store.</dd>
