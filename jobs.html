      <dt><strong>Baristas</dt></strong>

          handcrafting deliciously perfect beverages.<br>
          Connecting and creating the moments that make a difference in each
          person’s day.</dd>
      <dt><strong>Shift Supervisors</dt></strong>
        <dd>Shift Supervisors help direct work on the floor. Running a shift,
          leading a team, and making decisions that impact store<br>
          operations. A great way to develop leadership skills and expanded
          responsibility. They also help create great experiences <br>
          for partners and customers alike.</dd>
      <dt><strong>Assistant Store Managers</dt></strong>
        <dd>Assistant Store Managers inspire our customers while developing
          their management skills on their journey to running a <br>
          great store on their own. Managing a P&L for a million-dollar
          business, building schedules, leading a team and nurturing<br>
          talent—allowing those partners to become their personal best.</dd>
      <dt><strong>Store Managers</dt></strong>
        <dd>Store Managers run their own million-dollar business—from managing
          their store’s operations to responsibility for <br>
          financial results. This is not a back room management position. It’s
          being on the front line, connecting with customers and <br>
          partners. It’s the opportunity to develop your own team, hiring and
          welcoming new partners and future leaders for your <br>
          store.</dd>
